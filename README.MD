# LEARNING TERRAFORM WITH AWS
## https://www.learnterraform.io

In this project, I have developed a configuration for deploying a cluster of 
web servers using Terraform.

The infrastructure is deployed in a single AWS region, us-east-2 using the default VPC.
The cluster is made up of the following resources:
- Auto Scaling Group
- Launch Template
- Application Load Balancer
- Target Group
- Security Groups
